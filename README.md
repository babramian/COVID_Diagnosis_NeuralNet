# COVID_Diagnosis_NeuralNet

Jupyter notebooks files containing code for a neural network meant to diagnose patients for COVID-19.

# INCLUDED FILES:
  - Covid_Diagnosis_Neural_Net : contains code for training and saving a baseline neural network
  - Covid_NN : Contains code for training and saving a slightly more complex and accurate neural network
  - Covid_preprocessing : Contains code for preprocessing dirty data found online (one hot, normalization, resampling)
  - COVID_Diagnosis_Pipeline : Contains code for the full data ingestion pipeline (preprocessing, model loading, creating and saving predictions)

# ACCURACY RATES:
  - Saw highs of ~86% prediction accuracy
